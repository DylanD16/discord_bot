# Requirements
+ Latest version of python - https://www.python.org/downloads/latest

# Documentation
See the latest discord.py [documentation here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html)

# Setup 
+ Firstly you need to create a new bot application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and get the token
+ Make sure to [invite the bot to your server](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html)
+ You will also need to install the discord package by opening a command prompt window and typing `pip install discord`. If this errors try running it as an administrator. Otherwise checkout a guide on fixing your pip [here](https://appuals.com/fix-pip-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/).

![step1](https://github.com/Dylster888/slio.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/step1.jpg?raw=true)

+ Then duplicate the `config.json.example` file and rename it `config.json` or the code may not work
+ Open up the file and insert your token and prefix into the correct places

# Running
+ Once complete feel free to edit the code **locally** in the files you downloaded (Do not edit the github files unless fixing bugs). 
+ To run the bot, double click the file named `index.py` but make sure you are running it using python. If doing that correctly then a terminal window will open and say that the bot is online.
